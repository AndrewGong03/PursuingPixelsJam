  - Hide the dinosaurs! A small meteorite has just crashed onto the field and just
    narrowly stopped a Silicon Union goal!
  - "Does the ref allow Fortune City to grab the luck they\u2019ve been desperate
    for or lay down the law?"

  infoText: What will you do about the meteorite?
  redCardText:
  - Silicon was clearly about to score. Point for Silicon!
  - And the ref makes the tough decision to call it like he saw it.
  yellowCardText:
  - Silicon was moving forward. Free kick for Silicon!
  - "And the ref sides with the silicons! Let\u2019s see if they can make this kick
    count!"
  greenCardText:
  - Restart the game from center
  - This seems unfair to the Silicons and slows the game down!
