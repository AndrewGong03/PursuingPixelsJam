  - Well, well, well. Royal United's dog mascot is getting a little too friendly
    with the Brawlers' players! I've heard of leg humpers, but this is next level!
  - Our ref's got a peculiar problem to handle. Does he send the overly affectionate
    pooch packing, let the love fest continue, or don the spare mascot head and join
    the fun?
