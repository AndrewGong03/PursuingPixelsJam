  - Well, well, well. Royal United's dog mascot is getting a little too friendly
    with the Brawlers' players!
  - ' I''ve heard of leg humpers, but this is next level!'
  - Our ref's got a peculiar problem to handle.
  - Does he send the overly affectionate pooch packing, let the love fest continue,
    or don the spare mascot head and join the fun?
