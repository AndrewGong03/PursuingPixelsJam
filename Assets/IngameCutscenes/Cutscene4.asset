  - We've got a full-blown food fight on our hands, folks! Brawlers' fans are tossing
    their hot dogs and nachos like they're in a school cafeteria!
  - Ref's got a real snack attack to deal with.
  - Does he call for a time-out clean-up, let the game turn into a dodge-the-dinner
    event, or sample the field cuisine himself?
