  - Wait a minute! That's a disaster!
  - A Fortune City player just redirected the ball into his own net while trying
    to dodge a Silicon Union video drone! More like Unfortunate City.
  - Well, Chip, this is indeed a conundrum. The referee's got some decisions to make.

  infoText: How do you respond to the own-goal caused by the drone?
  redCardText:
  - Goal for Silicon Union!
  - The ref remains as heartless as the drone!
  yellowCardText:
  - No goal! Interference from the drone
  - And the ref lays down the law! No room for tech in this game of muscle.
  greenCardText:
  - No goal, and no more drones for the rest of the game!
  - Banning the drones entirely seems a bit harsh, no?
