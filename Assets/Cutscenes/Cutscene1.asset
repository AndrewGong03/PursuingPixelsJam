  - Oh, look at that! Prince Patrick's gone down in the box, flopping like a fish
    out of water. I've seen better dives at the kiddie pool!
  - This is the moment of truth. Does our ref fall for the royal performance, or
    does he play the role of a heartless critic?

  infoText: How will you respond to Prince Patrick's fall?
  redCardText:
  - Call a penalty against Brawlers FC
  - Not sure what the ref is on, that didn't look like a penalty to me!
  yellowCardText:
  - Call nothing
  - Looks like the ref didn't see anything.
  greenCardText:
  - Call out Prince Patrick for his theatrics
  - The ref isn't standing for Prince Patrick's shenanigans. I hear the crowd cheering
    on his decision!
